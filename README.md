# Bombón Dessert Menu - Mobile-First Digital Menu

This project is a mobile-first, responsive digital menu card website for "Bombón Dessert Menu," a fast-service food shop. The design focuses on providing customers with a quick and frictionless way to search, browse, and select menu items directly from their smartphones.

## 📱 Platform Focus

-   **Mobile-First:** The layout, navigation, and interactive elements are optimized for mobile screens.
-   **Thumb-Friendly:** The search bar, category scroller, and buttons are designed for easy, one-handed use.
-   **Phone-Only Responsive:** The design is tailored specifically for phone-sized viewports and does not extend to tablets or desktops, ensuring a focused and polished mobile experience.

## ✨ Features

-   **Instant Search:** A sticky search bar at the top allows users to filter the menu in real-time.
-   **Category Scroller:** A horizontally scrolling navigation bar provides quick access to all menu categories.
-   **Vibrant Design:** A pastel-based color palette (cyan, yellow, pink, tan) creates a youthful and indulgent atmosphere.
-   **Clear Item Display:** Each item is presented with its name, price, and an image placeholder. Special items are clearly marked.
